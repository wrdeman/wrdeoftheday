# Me

## Physicist
I started life as a physicist with a focus in understanding semiconductors lasers with the aim of making them efficient.
As time passed I became more interested in making lasers do wierd and wonderful things - emitting two colors at once and acting as an optical RAM. All my publications are [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Sd_bCNYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

## Developer
Moving on... After cutting it as a physicist, I decided to follow my dream of becoming a professional coder. In short physics was becoming a blocker to programming.

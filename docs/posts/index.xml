      <description>Another blog about kubernetes and raspberry pis Why am I doing this? Why don&amp;rsquo;t you use minikube? It&amp;rsquo;s something to do.
I have followed this blog post: https://uthark.github.io/post/2020-09-02-installing-kubernetes-raspberrypi/ and where possible convert it into ansible.
The code is at https://github.com/wrdeman/wrde-pi
Topology I will have 4 Pis for the kubernetes cluster, a master and three workers, and a Pi acting as a network file system. They Pis are a combination of 4 and 3Bs.</description>

      <description>How to use bitbucket pipelines to generate LaTex documents Why do this? Itâ€™s a handy way to have LaTex documents on the go and collaboration.
Docker container The typical way of installing LaTex is texlive and one would normally install the full version. Whilst, this is great it is pretty big. So I have created a container with a basic LaTex installation: https://hub.docker.com/r/wrdeman/docker-min-tex This may or may not meet your requirements.</description>

      <description>Concurrency, Django and Apache Bench The motivation for this blog was as a starting point in debugging errors caused errors caused by concurrency or race conditions - the so-called Heisenbug. I am going to use a contrived example of a bank account with a method to withdraw money and record each transaction. Then I will make a number of concurrent requests and investigate any undesired effects. I do not, in this blog, seek to propose any solution to these effects - solely to provide a means of determining whether they are present.</description>

      <title>Average House Prices</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the average house price in a school&amp;rsquo;s catchment area? In order to calculate the average house price in a school&amp;rsquo;s catchment area, we are going to use PostGIS and OpenStreetMap. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to know the price and location of houses sold in that area, and the location of the schools and it&amp;rsquo;s catchment area. The former can be determined from the land registry and although this does not provide any geocoding we can do this using data provided by OpenStreetMap&amp;rsquo;s Nominatim.</description>

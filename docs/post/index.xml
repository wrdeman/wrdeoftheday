      <description>Concurrency, Django and Apache Bench The motivation for this blog was as a starting point in debugging errors caused errors caused by concurrency or race conditions - the so-called Heisenbug. I am going to use a contrived example of a bank account with a method to withdraw money and record each transaction. Then I will make a number of concurrent requests and investigate any undesired effects. I do not, in this blog, seek to propose any solution to these effects - solely to provide a means of determining whether they are present.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the average house price in a school&amp;rsquo;s catchment area? In order to calculate the average house price in a school&amp;rsquo;s catchment area, we are going to use PostGIS and OpenStreetMap. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to know the price and location of houses sold in that area, and the location of the schools and it&amp;rsquo;s catchment area. The former can be determined from the land registry and although this does not provide any geocoding we can do this using data provided by OpenStreetMap&amp;rsquo;s Nominatim.</description>
